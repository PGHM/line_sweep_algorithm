# Line sweep algorithm for finding line intersections

As part of the Spatial Data Algorithms course I had to do a project and I
chose the hardest algorithm that was available because I wanted to challenge
myself. It turned out to be the correct choice, it was at the same time
challenging and fun. I got to apply my programming skills in a very different
context than before.

Reading the code afterwards I would probably do some things differently, but
considering the time that I spent writing that code (20 hours) the result is
very good. I decided not to use any libraries and did the required data
structures myself. It was nice to realize how I could use binary search in the
priority queue implementation to optimize it!

## Documentation

This course required very diligent documentation and a learning diary. At the
time it was not very fun at all, but now when I am reading this later it is so
good to see what I was thinking back then and how the project shaped up. I
feel the documentation is quite good and there are no useless rambling.

## Running the code

You just need Python 2.6 or 2.7 to run the code. Probably pretty easy to
modify to be able to run with Python 3.x.
